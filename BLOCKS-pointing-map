# COLIBR√ç Blocks
#
# This file defines the blocks that are loaded or unloaded.
#
# Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.
#
# The first four fields are:
#
# 1. Action. Either "load" or "unload".
#
# 2. Priority. A letter, with a being highest priority and z being lowest
# priority.
#
# 3. Duplicates. The number of copies of the block file that are loaded into the
# queue. This is useful when breaking long observations into shorter blocks;
# simply set this field to the number times you want to run the shorter block.
#
# 4. Block file. This can be a file name or a shell glob pattern to match a set
# of file names. Omit the trailing ".json".
#
# After the first four columns, it is possible to add a time specification:
#
# - day M N. Carry out the action every N days. Specifically, only load
# the block files into the queue if M = D mod N, in which D is the day of the
# year (1 to 366).
#
# - date YYYMMDD. Carry out the action on the specified UTC date.
#
# If no time specification is given, the action is carried out every day.
