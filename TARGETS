# This file specifies targets to observe. At 00:00 UTC, these targets
# are automatically loaded into the block pool.
#
# The fields are:
#
# 1. Priority from 1 to 10, with 1 being highest priority and 10 being
# lowest priority. Priority 0 is reserved for focus blocks. As a guide,
# automatic alerts are generated with the following priorities:
#
#   2 = multi-messenger
#   3 = LVC
#   4 = SVOM/ECL, SVOM/MXT, or SVOM/VT
#   5 = Fermi/LAT
#   7 = Fermi/GBM and SGRB
#   8 = Swift
#   10 = everything else
#
# Note that while alerts are generated for LVC and Fermi/GBM, the
# positional uncertainties are so large that they will not be selectable
# unless there is a coincident alert with a sufficiently small
# positional uncertainty (essentially, from SVOM, Swift, or Fermi/LAT).
#
# 2. Subpriority from a to z. a is highest and z is lowest subpriority.
#
# 3. Repeats. How many times this block should be run.
#
# 4. Program identifier. If necessary, add the corresponding name to
# NAMES.
#
# 5. Block identifier. If necessary, add the corresponding name to
# NAMES.
#
# 6 and 7. The coordinates alpha and delta. These can be either
# sexagesimal or decimal degrees with a "d" suffix.
#
# 8. The maximum airmass at which the target should be observed. The
# telescope is limited to zenith distances of 72d or less, which
# correspond to airmasses of 3.2 and less. Observations are further
# constrained to astronomical twilight or night and to being no closer
# than 15d from the Moon.
#
# 9. Exposure repeats. The number of exposures in each filter.
#
# 10. Exposure time. Individual exposure time in seconds.
#
# 11. Filters. This can be: any single filter (g, r, i, B, gri) or one
# of the combinations g/r, g/r/z, g/i, g/i/z, r/i, r/i/z, g/r/i/z, or
# g/r/i/z/y.
#
# 12 and more. The visit name. You can use more than one field here.
#
# Try to keep individual blocks to less than about half an hour in
# length. For example:
#
#  - with 1 filter  use at most 24 x 60 seconds
#  - with 2 filters use at most 12 x 60 seconds
#  - with 3 filters use at most  8 x 60 seconds.
#
# Lines that begin with # are ignored.
